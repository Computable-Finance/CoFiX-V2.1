# ICoFiXRouter

## 1. Interface Description
    This interface defines methods for CoFiXRouter

## 2. Method Description

### 2.1. Register trade pair

```javascript
    /// @dev Register trade pair
    /// @param token0 pair-token0. 0 address means eth
    /// @param token1 pair-token1. 0 address means eth
    /// @param pool Pool for the trade pair
    function registerPair(address token0, address token1, address pool) external;
```

### 2.2. Get pool address for trade pair

```javascript
    /// @dev Get pool address for trade pair
    /// @param token0 pair-token0. 0 address means eth
    /// @param token1 pair-token1. 0 address means eth
    /// @return pool Pool for the trade pair
    function pairFor(address token0, address token1) external view returns (address pool);
```

### 2.3. Register routing path

```javascript
    /// @dev Register routing path
    /// @param src Src token address
    /// @param dest Dest token address
    /// @param path Routing path
    function registerRouterPath(address src, address dest, address[] calldata path) external;
```

### 2.4. Get routing path from src token address to dest token address

```javascript
    /// @dev Get routing path from src token address to dest token address
    /// @param src Src token address
    /// @param dest Dest token address
    /// @return path If success, return the routing path, 
    /// each address in the array represents the token address experienced during the trading
    function getRouterPath(address src, address dest) external view returns (address[] memory path);
```

### 2.5. Maker add liquidity to pool

```javascript
    /// @dev Maker add liquidity to pool, get pool token (mint XToken to maker) 
    /// (notice: msg.value = amountETH + oracle fee)
    /// @param  pool The address of pool
    /// @param  token The address of ERC20 Token
    /// @param  amountETH The amount of ETH added to pool. (When pool is AnchorPool, amountETH is 0)
    /// @param  amountToken The amount of Token added to pool
    /// @param  liquidityMin The minimum liquidity maker wanted
    /// @param  to The target address receiving the liquidity pool (XToken)
    /// @param  deadline The deadline of this request
    /// @return xtoken The liquidity share token address obtained
    /// @return liquidity The real liquidity or XToken minted from pool
    function addLiquidity(
        address pool,
        address token,
        uint amountETH,
        uint amountToken,
        uint liquidityMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external payable returns (address xtoken, uint liquidity);
```
    Note: At present, there are two kinds of fund pools: binary pool and anchor pool. Adding liquidity to 
    binary pool requires both Eth and token to be provided proportionally. Adding liquidity to anchor pool 
    requires adding a single asset. Therefore, when adding liquidity to anchor pool, amounteth should be 0 
    (for eth anchor pool, when adding liquidity, amounteth is 0, amounttoken is eth quantity, token is 0 address).

### 2.6. Maker add liquidity to pool and stake

```javascript
    /// @dev Maker add liquidity to pool, get pool token (mint XToken) and stake automatically 
    /// (notice: msg.value = amountETH + oracle fee)
    /// @param  pool The address of pool
    /// @param  token The address of ERC20 Token
    /// @param  amountETH The amount of ETH added to pool. (When pool is AnchorPool, amountETH is 0)
    /// @param  amountToken The amount of Token added to pool
    /// @param  liquidityMin The minimum liquidity maker wanted
    /// @param  to The target address receiving the liquidity pool (XToken)
    /// @param  deadline The deadline of this request
    /// @return xtoken The liquidity share token address obtained
    /// @return liquidity The real liquidity or XToken minted from pool
    function addLiquidityAndStake(
        address pool,
        address token,
        uint amountETH,
        uint amountToken,
        uint liquidityMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external payable returns (address xtoken, uint liquidity);
```

### 2.7. Maker remove liquidity from pool

```javascript
    /// @dev Maker remove liquidity from pool to get ERC20 Token and ETH back (maker burn XToken) 
    /// (notice: msg.value = oracle fee)
    /// @param  pool The address of pool
    /// @param  token The address of ERC20 Token
    /// @param  liquidity The amount of liquidity (XToken) sent to pool, or the liquidity to remove
    /// @param  amountETHMin The minimum amount of ETH wanted to get from pool
    /// @param  to The target address receiving the Token
    /// @param  deadline The deadline of this request
    /// @return amountETH The real amount of ETH transferred from the pool
    /// @return amountToken The real amount of Token transferred from the pool
    function removeLiquidityGetTokenAndETH(
        address pool,
        address token,
        uint liquidity,
        uint amountETHMin,
        address to,
        uint deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint amountETH, uint amountToken);
```

### 2.8. Swap exact tokens for tokens

```javascript
    /// @dev Swap exact tokens for tokens
    /// @param  path Routing path. If you need to exchange through multi-level routes, you need to write down all 
    /// token addresses (ETH address is represented by 0) of the exchange path
    /// @param  amountIn The exact amount of Token a trader want to swap into pool
    /// @param  amountOutMin The minimum amount of ETH a trader want to swap out of pool
    /// @param  to The target address receiving the ETH
    /// @param  rewardTo The target address receiving the CoFi Token as rewards
    /// @param  deadline The deadline of this request
    /// @return amountOut The real amount of Token transferred out of pool
    function swapExactTokensForTokens(
        address[] calldata path,
        uint amountIn,
        uint amountOutMin,
        address to,
        address rewardTo,
        uint deadline
    ) external payable returns (uint amountOut);
```
    Note: For multi-level route exchange, the path can be queried through getrouterpath(), 
    or the transaction pair data can be cached at the front end and generated by itself.

### 2.9. Acquire the transaction mining share of the target XToken

```javascript
    /// @dev Acquire the transaction mining share of the target XToken
    /// @param xtoken The destination XToken address
    /// @return Target XToken's transaction mining share
    function getTradeReward(address xtoken) external view returns (uint);
```
